# Text answers from Week 0

# Name: Brendan Gassler



Explain what each of the following lines does. Use the terminology you learned from the book (or Google)
	
	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld()
	bob = Turtle()
	wait_for_user()

Answer: The first line imports everything from the TurtleWorld class
the second line creates a new TurtleWorld called world. the third line creates a new turtle named bob. The last line instructs the program to wait for input from the user






These questions pertain to the program you wrote in Week0.

-- What are the arguments of polygon()?  What type is each argument?
Answer: a turtle (turtle), length of the sides (integer), and number of sides(integer)

-- What two turtle functions did you use to draw the sides of the polygon?
Answer: the fd and lt functions

-- What are the arguments for polyline?  What type is each argument?
Answer: a turtle (turtle), number of sides (integer), length of side (integer), angle(integer)





Suppose you wrote a function, center_circle(), that draws a circle of a given radius around the current location of the turtle and restores the turtle to its starting point.

-- What turtle functions would you use to move the turtle from the center to the edge of the circle and get ready to call the original circle() function?
Answer: the move() function

-- Suppose the interface of this function requires the turtle to end up in the same place it started, facing in the same direction it started.
Answer: I would still use the move function again at the end and give it a negative input

-- What is this type of requirement called?
Answer: a precondition
